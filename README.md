### Overview 

This microservice is designed to manage and process users' gold purchase requests regularly. Users can select a specific day and set it as the designated day of each month. The microservice, upon reaching this date, processes the gold purchase requests of users for the specified amount, and executes the relevant transactions. Docker, .NET Core, PostgreSQL, and RabbitMQ technologies have been used in the development of this software.
